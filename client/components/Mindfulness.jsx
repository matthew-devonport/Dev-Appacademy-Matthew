                    <p><span className='technic-title'>Mindfulness</span> is a form of meditation.
                        It's paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment, non judgmentally, simply noticing what you are experiencing, without criticisms or judgments or evaluations.
                        Mindfulness helps us develop our attention and meta-attention.
                        We can pay attention to breathing sensations in the belly and be aware when the attention is somewhere else.
